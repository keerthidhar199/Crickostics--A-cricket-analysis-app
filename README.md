## About
I have created this app to analyse cricket statistics for users. It gives the user an experience of the current form and game of each player with respect to the Venue played, Team played against, Overall Match analysis for each team. Can be used extensively for deciding the playing 11 of your fantasy team, Know the patterns and variations for any cricket league. It is based on Webscraping data so it is kind of live data.You will be shown the details of all the happening matches in your home screen clicking on which you would be redirected to the analytics part. It is UI driven made to understand the stats at your fingertips. It is to be noted that the stats would help in understanding the way of how the game works and may not always guarantee a win.
